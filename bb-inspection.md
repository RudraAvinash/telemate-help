# BB Inspection

BB Team can make "Security and Code Bugs\&Style" Inspection for your bot.

This inspection is an indicator of the quality of your bot. After verification, you will receive:

* a quantitative rating of your bot from 0 to 5
* inspection document with descriptions of vulnerabilities, bugs and bad code styling. See [example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16QCbOTo\_c02Gra9zBknFAR5zxtFiKSXmcL5\_9iA\_RAU/edit)

{% hint style="success" %}
If you buy a bot from a third-party developer, a good rating is a great reason to buy a bot.
